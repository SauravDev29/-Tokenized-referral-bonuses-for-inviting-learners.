# Tokenized Referral Bonuses for Inviting Learners

## Project Description
This project implements a blockchain-based solution for tokenized referral bonuses. Users who invite learners to a platform are rewarded with tokens ("ReferralToken" or "RTK") as an incentive. The system is built using a smart contract that handles token distribution, referrals, and rewards transparently and securely.

## Project Vision
To create a decentralized and transparent mechanism that incentivizes community-driven growth by rewarding users with tokenized bonuses for inviting new learners. This initiative promotes fairness, engagement, and the expansion of the learning ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **ERC20 Token Compliance**: Fully functional tokens adhering to the ERC20 standard.
- **Referral Bonuses**: Users receive RTK tokens for successfully referring learners to the platform.

## Future Improvements
- **Multi-Tier Referral System**: Implementing a system that rewards users for multi-level referrals to encourage network expansion.
- **Dynamic Referral Bonuses**: Allowing bonus amounts to adjust dynamically based on the activity level of referred learners.
- **Integration with Learning Platforms**: Direct integration with e-learning platforms for automated tracking and rewarding of referrals.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Adding a dashboard for users and administrators to view referral statistics and token balances.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Expanding the contract to support multiple blockchain networks for broader accessibility.
- **Staking and Utility**: Introducing staking mechanisms and utility for RTK tokens within the learning ecosystem, such as discounts or access to premium content.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Allowing token holders to vote on changes to referral bonus policies and other parameters.
- **Security Enhancements**: Regular audits and bug bounty programs to ensure the contract's security and reliability.
